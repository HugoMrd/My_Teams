The following are the mandatory Teams commands from client to server:

               /help                                                  : Show help

               /user [“user_uuid”]                                    : get details about the requested user
            
               /send [“user_uuid”] [“message_body”]                   : send a message to specific user
            
               /messages [“user_uuid”]                                : list all messages exchanged with the specified user
            
               /subscribe [“team_uuid”]                               : subscribe to the events of a team and its sub directories (enable reception of all events from a team)
            
               /subscribed ?[“team_uuid”]                             : list all subscribed teams or list all users subscribed to a team

               /use ?[“team_uuid”] ?[“channel_uuid”] ?[“thread_uuid”] : Sets the command context to a team/channel/thread
            
               /create                                                : based on the context, create the sub resource (see below)
            
               /list                                                  : based on the context, list all the sub resources (see below)

               /list : list all existing teams                        : when team_uuid is defined (/use “team_uuid”):
               
               /list : list all existing channels                     : when team_uuid and channel_uuid are defined (/use “team_uuid” “channel_uuid”):
               
               /list : list all existing threads                      : when team_uuid, channel_uuid and thread_uuid are defined (/use “team_uuid” “channel_uuid” “thread_uuid”):
               
               /list : list all existing replies

               /info : display currently logged-in user details       : when team_uuid is defined (/use “team_uuid”):
               
               /info : display currently selected team details        : when team_uuid and channel_uuid are defined (/use “team_uuid” “channel_uuid”):
